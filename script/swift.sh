# SwiftPM can run. When that CLT layout is detected, prefer an installed Xcode
# that carries the framework in the location SwiftPM expects. An explicit
# DEVELOPER_DIR from the caller always wins.

# commands. This is intentionally opt-in: deprecated SwiftPM build systems are
# useful for diagnosing toolchain bugs, but the project default should remain
# the supported SwiftPM backend.
